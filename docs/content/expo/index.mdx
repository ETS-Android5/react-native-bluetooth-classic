## Expo Installation

Install `react-native-bluetooth-classic` and `with-rn-bluetooth-classic` (for auto-configuration of permissions and protocols) from `npm` with `expo install`:

```
expo install react-native-bluetooth-classic with-rn-bluetooth-classic
```

Configure `app.json` or `app.config.json` with the following:

```
"plugins": [
      ["with-bluetooth-classic",
        {
          "peripheralUsageDescription": "Allow myDevice to check bluetooth peripheral info",
          "alwaysUsageDescription": "Allow myDevice to always use bluetooth info",
          "protocols": [
            "com.myCompany.p1",
            "com.myCompany.p2"
          ]
        }
      ]
    ]
```
